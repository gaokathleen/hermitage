With rapidity and finesse, he has risen to be quite the starlet, a darling of high society. Although Herbert blushes easily and adores indulging in the occasional fur, he tells fortunes with startling accuracy and is always punctual. His other specialties include silver-polishing, preparing bubble baths, and debutante balls. He has two sisters, both named Herb.</div>

Lantern-bearing Geoff is the perfect solution for any lord or lady partial to an evening stroll. He may be near-sighted, but Geoff provides a warm, soft ambience visible across a fifty metre radius. Wise and patient, Geoff is happy to spend his days poring over the latest literature with a cup of tea at the ready. He always smells of bergamot. A selective vegetarian, Geoff’s favorite food is lobster, but only when it is free.</div>

His favourite pastime is gardening, which he attributes to maintaining his shapely figure. Any lord or lady lucky enough to visit Norman during the harvest season is certainly in for a treat! An avid and experienced baker, he is beloved for sending guests home with a piece of his famous strawberry-rhubarb pie. He is impassioned about his after forenoon naps and loves to take them in his garden.</div>

                        <p>We created L’Hermitage to serve as a gnome marketplace for Victorian elite. As the eligible lords and ladies of our country enter a search for their perfect hermit, we wanted to provide a reliable selection of such hardy, healthy, and habitable overseers of property. An exquisite addition to the visual landscape, these gnomes are suited to live in hermitages along the outskirts of large estates and demonstrate incredible fealty to the landowners upon whose property they reside. Although they prefer a life of seclusion, they will happily entertain guests of high society that seek their wisdom and sage advice. </p>
                        <p>Lauded by <em>Gnomes and Gardens</em> and featured in <em>Gnome Appetit</em>’s End-of-the-Year Top 10 List, L’Hermitage has established itself as a forerunner and innovator in the gnome marketplace. Pairing desiring lords and ladies with the most honourable of hermits for over 50 years, we aim to continue providing the best of service.</p>
